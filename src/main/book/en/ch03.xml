	<title>Jenkins and TestLink Integration</title>
	
	<para>The integration between Jenkins and TestLink can be achieved with 
	Jenkins TestLink Plug-in. The plug-in resides in Jenkins, being able to 
	use some of its nice features like executing multiple jobs, scheduling 
	jobs, distributed execution and a plethora of plug-ins. To retrieve the 
	data from TestLink for tests, as well as to report the test case execution 
	status to TestLink, the plug-in uses TestLink XML-RPC API.</para>
	
	<para>This way, while Jenkins handles the execution of jobs and tasks such 
	as downloading source code from an SCM, TestLink maintains the structure of 
	your tests, as well as other assets such as Test Plan, Custom Fields, Reports 
	and Baselines.</para>
	
	<para>We will see how to configure our environment for this integration 
	throughout the next chapters. While it is good to have a written 
	explanation on how this integration works, probably it is a lot easier to 
	understand how it works with a hands-on. The rest of this guide explains 
	how to configure Jenkins and TestLink to run automated tests from a sample  
	test project. This test project is a Java project that uses Maven and  
	TestNG and you can download the source code from

	being written is <emphasis>3.0.2</emphasis>.</para>
